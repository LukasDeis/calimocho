WORKSHOP
    - fix J regularizer for classification
    - implement learning-to-rank for corrections

    - define partial corrections [with marginalization]
    - define geometric margin on w
    - implement uncertainty sampling on label + explanations

    - setup experiment with deeper nets, show that they can be learned from few
      fat examples


Q1 LIME vs SENN
    - compare explanation quality
    - compare stability
    - compare runtime

Q2 CAIPI vs CALI
    - compare data augmentation vs learning-to-rank vs IG?
        - label perf, expl perf, runtime

Q3 CALI-USY vs CALI-USYZ
    - compare types
