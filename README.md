# CALIMOCHO

An implementation of Explanatory Active Learning (XAL) based on
Self-explainable Neural Networks.

See:

* Stefano Teso - *Toward Faithful Explanatory Interactive Machine Learning*, submitted to the 3rd International Tutorial & Workshop on Interactive and Adaptive Learning (IAL'19).
* Stefano Teso and Kristian Kersting - *Explanatory Interactive Machine Learning*, International Conference on AI, Ethics and Society, 2019.


### Experiments & Dataset

Our preliminary experiments use the synthetic colors dataset from:

* Andrew Ross, Michael C. Hughes, Finale Doshi-Velez - *Right for the right reasons: Training differentiable models by constraining their explanations*

The original data can be found on the [rrr repo](https://github.com/dtak/rrr).  We used the preprocessed dataset from the [caipi repo](https://github.com/stefanoteso/caipi).
